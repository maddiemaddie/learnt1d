<h1>Symptoms &amp; Causes</h1>
<p>What are the symptoms of diabetes?</p>
<p>Symptoms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=A9A7D1B1D5964819A072158BB2D1F216&amp;_z=z">diabetes</a>&nbsp;include</p>
<ul>
<li>increased thirst and urination</li>
<li>increased hunger</li>
<li>fatigue</li>
<li>blurred vision</li>
<li>numbness or tingling in the feet or hands</li>
<li>sores that do not heal</li>
<li>unexplained weight loss</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly&mdash;over the course of several years&mdash;and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=83E3987900914ECEA732447973A2CD15&amp;_z=z">heart trouble</a>.</p>
<h2>What causes type 1 diabetes?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=F1883489962F431696BD16F21B24491A&amp;_z=z">Type 1 diabetes</a>&nbsp;occurs when your immune system, the body&rsquo;s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=E4F45E1ECD364F7D946A83B83003340A&amp;_z=z">insulin</a>-producing beta cells of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=7C416DD4D72945BF9B7C87D9A8B1DA3D&amp;_z=z">pancreas</a>. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=EEC743B1357849B893AFA4C6917CEB62&amp;_z=z">genes</a>&nbsp;and environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trialnet.org/">TrialNet</a>&nbsp;are working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.</p>
<h2>What causes type 2 diabetes?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=2FBD8504EC0343C8A56B091324664FAE&amp;_z=z">Type 2 diabetes</a>&mdash;the most common form of diabetes&mdash;is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.</p>
<h3>Overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity</h3>
<p>You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=6556C7CD50724FA2BB11683ED6B806AD&amp;_z=z">overweight</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=7E2D5D6DA1004DD78D72F828FCF18813&amp;_z=z">obese</a>. Extra weight sometimes causes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=511B446858184C2AB633A71BEA2462B5&amp;_z=z">insulin resistance</a>&nbsp;and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=34C3C613335643BDB2AB6369C8744B83&amp;_z=z">heart and blood vessel disease</a>. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=770DE5B5E26E496D87BD89CC50712CDC&amp;_z=z#BMI">Body Mass Index (BMI) charts</a>.</p>
<h3>Insulin resistance</h3>
<p>Type 2 diabetes usually begins with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=A061625CFE984C7695A76D8D3F6C5BC8&amp;_z=z">insulin resistance</a>, a condition in which muscle,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=7A202A9FE2DF44CCAD410290A45DA829&amp;_z=z">liver</a>, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=5BA41B5969654F3EBEFA053C3A80CBE6&amp;_z=z">glucose</a>&nbsp;enter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can&rsquo;t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.</p>
<h3>Genes and family history</h3>
<p>As in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>African Americans</li>
<li>Alaska Natives</li>
<li>American Indians</li>
<li>Asian Americans</li>
<li>Hispanics/Latinos</li>
<li>Native Hawaiians</li>
<li>Pacific Islanders</li>
</ul>
<p>Genes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person&rsquo;s tendency to become overweight or obese.</p>
<h2>What causes gestational diabetes?</h2>
<p>Scientists believe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=D7C67F2866FC4471A633B43EE345D7AC&amp;_z=z">gestational diabetes</a>, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.</p>
<h3>Insulin resistance</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=0C2DFA8740434D4D9FB3D46BA0F185AB&amp;_z=z">Hormones</a>&nbsp;produced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/19681.htm">placenta</a>&nbsp;contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can&rsquo;t make enough insulin.</p>
<p>As with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or obese may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.</p>
<h3>Genes and family history</h3>
<p>Having a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.</p>
<h2>What else can cause diabetes?</h2>
<p><a href="https://medlineplus.gov/geneticdisorders.html">Genetic mutations</a>, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.</p>
<h3>Genetic mutations</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=03A07A695FC143AC8495A219F5011CE1&amp;_z=z">Monogenic diabetes&nbsp;</a>is caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.</li>
<li><a href="https://medlineplus.gov/cysticfibrosis.html">Cystic fibrosis</a>&nbsp;produces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=0AE87618C2AC484397215A8EB2C21042&amp;_z=z">Hemochromatosis</a>&nbsp;causes the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hormonal diseases</h3>
<p>Some hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=AC231707D995498090E5C98796EAF4EC&amp;_z=z">Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome</a>&nbsp;occurs when the body produces too much&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=9BE8BF67F61F45D8B9C5D448911A33EE&amp;_z=z">cortisol</a>&mdash;often called the &ldquo;stress hormone.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=F6F3FF8FE23D4C02AED069A7B643A607&amp;_z=z">Acromegaly</a>&nbsp;occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=909298345BE34B969DED0AF69DB0948C&amp;_z=z">Hyperthyroidism</a>&nbsp;occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Damage to or removal of the pancreas</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/syndication/~/link.aspx?_id=8A4DF7F5B1F44F0E89D15907D40BEAF7&amp;_z=z">Pancreatitis</a>, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.</p>
<h3>Medicines</h3>
<p>Sometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include</p>
<ul>
<li>niacin, a type of vitamin B3</li>
<li>certain types of diuretics, also called water pills</li>
<li>anti-seizure drugs</li>
<li>psychiatric drugs</li>
<li>drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html">HIV</a>)</li>
<li>pentamidine, a drug used to treat&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/pneumocystis-pneumonia/">a type of pneumonia</a></li>
<li>glucocorticoids&mdash;medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as&nbsp;<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/rheumatoidarthritis.html">rheumatoid arthritis</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/asthma.html">asthma</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lupus.html">lupus</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/ulcerative-colitis">ulcerative colitis</a></li>
<li>anti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ</li>
</ul>
<p>Statins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (&ldquo;bad&rdquo;) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you&rsquo;ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.</p>
<p>If you take any of these medicines and are concerned about their side effects, talk with your doctor.</p>
